Wherein I talk to myself about how to track linking of rooms and cost of doors.

find paths through dungeon
    foreach room/stairs
        add room as node to graph   (does having monsters increase the cost of passing this node?)
        foreach door
            make a stack of gridspaces
            push door gridspace on visited stack
            call doorcreep(stack)
            get list of door information and travel cost
            add door paths to graph as edges
    
    get all up stairs
    get all down stairs

    foreach combination of up and down stairs
        djikstra from up to down


doorcreep(stack)
    current = top of stack
    collect adjacent doors in doors stack
    if doors stack is not empty
        collect identifying door information and travel cost (door locks/traps increase cost?)
    
    collect adjacent unvisited corridor gridspace in border stack
    foreach gridspace in border stack
        push unvisited corridor gridspace on stack with cost (1 for empty room, more if trapped)
        return call doorcreep(stack)
    
    return stack of door information and travel cost
